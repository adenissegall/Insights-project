# Correlation analysis and Linear Regression model
This is a insight's project to answer the following question: where a store should invest to get more revenue: on website experience or app experience?<br><br>
Here i have used some correlation analysis and developed a Linear Regression model to predict the Yearly Amount Spent by user based on its data about app consumption, website consumption, time spent on stylist sessions and length of membership. The model itself doesn't provide the answer to the question but it's a plus in case the company wants to predict the amount spent based on customer data.
